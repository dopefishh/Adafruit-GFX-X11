# X11\_GFX

`X11_GFX` is a library that allows Arduino programs to run
`Adafruit-GFX-Library` code to execute on `X` servers using `Xlib`.

## Installation

Make sure that you have the development libraries for Xlib installed.

    apt-get install libx11-dev

And then run `make` to build the test executable.

## License

Adafruit-GFX-Library is `BSD` and so is this library.
